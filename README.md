# Budget Sales Analysis Project
Project 3

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize budget sales data to provide insights into sales performance, budget adherence, and customer behavior. The goal is to extract valuable information about sales, budgets, and variances, and create comprehensive dashboards to visualize key metrics and relationships between various attributes. The analysis is conducted using Python programming and various visualization tools.

## Problem Statement

Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase domains immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it. The objective of this project is to extract and analyze information such as sales, budget, and variance, compare sales and budgets with various attributes, and extract necessary information about products and customers to create meaningful dashboards.

## Objectives

* Analyze sales data to identify key trends and patterns.
* Compare sales and budgets to understand variances.
* Extract and analyze information about products and customers.
* Develop interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and relationships between attributes.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis includes various attributes such as:

  * Sales 
  * Budget 
  * Customer
  * Product
  * Territory
  * Calender

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert data types for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics to understand the distribution of data.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop interactive dashboards using visualization tools.
   - Include various features to explore data and extract meaningful insights.

## Dashboards

The interactive dashboards created in this project provide a comprehensive view of budget sales data:

* **Sales Overview Dashboard**: Shows total sales, budget, and variance.
* **Customer Insights Dashboard**: Visualizes customer behavior and key segments.
* **Product Performance Dashboard**: Highlights sales performance of different products and categories.
